# Internationalization Instructions

This document describes how to add a new language to the client.

## How to add a new language

1.  Create a new file in the `client/src/locale` directory with the name of the language code (e.g. `en-GB.locale.ts` for British English).
2.  Copy the contents of `client/src/locale/en-US.locale.ts` into the new file.
3.  Translate the strings in the new file.
4.  Add the new language to the `client/src/locale/locale.ts` file. You can add it to the `translations` object, similar to how the other languages are added.
5.  Add the new language key (e.g. `en-GB`) to the `localeFlags` object with the corresponding flag emoji and label.

## How to add a new translation key

1.  Add the new key to the `client/src/locale/locale.ts` file, inside the exported `Locale` interface.
2.  Update all the existing language files with the new key.
